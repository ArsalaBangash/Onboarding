Congratulations on getting your accounts and development tools up! üèÅ

Before we get to your first contribution, we would like to ensure you know one more language that's essential to how we communicate over the web: 

Markdown offers a simple way for people who code and those who don't to write and format text without having to rely on HTML or WYSIWYG editors.

<alert>
In computing, WYSIWYG, an acronym for What You See Is What You Get, is a system in which editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. Wikipedia

Markdown is a more intuitive alternative to HTML because you save time by not having to close HTML tags.

For those using a WYSIWYG editor, Markdown allows you to keep your fingers on the keyboard when formatting text, so you don't have to grab the mouse in order to select and format your text before returning to typing.

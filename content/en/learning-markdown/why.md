Markdown offers a simple way for everyone on the web to communicate without having to rely on HTML or _WYSIWYG_ editors.

<alert>
In computing, WYSIWYG is an acronym for What You See Is What You Get. 

Examples of WYSIWYG editors include Microsoft Word and Google Docs!

üí° For those using a WYSIWYG editor, Markdown allows you to keep your fingers on the keyboard when formatting text, so you don't have to grab the mouse in order to select and format your text before returning to typing.

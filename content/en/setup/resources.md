Great work getting your accounts set up! üèÅ

Now before getting into the learning, would like to recommend some resources that we regularly use here at Grey Software. 

<alert>
You can always come back to install our recommended software tools. You do not need to install our recommended resources, but we highly recommend checking them out to make your open source development journey more enjoyable.

## Brave Browser and Firefox

Most of our projects management and development happens on web browsers, and there are two major open source engines in the market right now: Chromium and Firefox Quantum.

Add Grey software, we regularly use both browser engines for diverse compatability, and our favorite browsers to work with are Mozilla Firefox and Brave.

## Bitwarden

Bitwarden is a free and open-source password management service
that stores sensitive information such as website credentials in an encrypted vault.

We use Bitwarden to manage the multiple passwords and API access keys we have to create as modern software developers. If you use another password manager, you may continue to do so :)

## VisBug

VisBug is an open-source web extension that allows users to interact with their webpage using powerful tools that can edit elements and inspect styles. 

Our team at Grey Software highly recommends having this extension since it has allowed us to treat the webpage as an art-board that we can edit and inspect before heading back into the code editor.

## Figma

Figma is a web-based graphic and user interface design app. It allows you to collaborate on design files with your team in real time, and fits very well in the toolkit of a frontend web developer. 

At Grey Software, we use Figma for our UI design and prototyping work.

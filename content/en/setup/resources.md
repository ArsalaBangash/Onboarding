Great work getting your accounts set up! üèÅ

Now before getting into the learning, would like to recommend some resources that we regularly use here at Grey Software.

## Brave Browser and Firefox

Most of our projects management and development happens on web browsers, and there are two major open source engines in the market right now: Chromium and Firefox Quantum.

Add Grey software, we regularly use both browser engines for diverse compatability, and our favorite browsers to work with are Mozilla Firefox and Brave.

## Figma

Figma is a web-based graphic and user interface design app. It allows you to collaborate on design files with your team in real time, and fits very well in the toolkit of a frontend web developer.

At Grey Software, we use Figma for our UI design and prototyping work.

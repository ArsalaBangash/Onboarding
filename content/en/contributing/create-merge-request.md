## Merge your changes, but ask nicely :)

When developers around the world to collaborate on large projects, how do they ensure that there is order when merging branches back into the main or master branch?

Well...they submit a request to the repository maintainers with merge access to merge their changes. Thus, we have the merge request. 

<alert>
You may have heard of pull requests and merge request. While both mean the same thing, the difference is that pull request is used by Github and merge request is used by Gitlab. 
</alert>

A Merge Request (MR) is a request to merge one branch into another.

Previously, we had created a new branch and committed our profile data model's changes to that branch. 

 We now need to merge these changes into the master branch so we can see our profile appear on the live https://org.grey.software website.

## Merge Request

A Merge Request (MR) is a request to merge one branch into another.

As Previously, we created a new branch and inside the branch we commit new changes. Now we need to commit these changes on the master branch so we can see the changes on the website.

* Click on the **create merge request** as shown in the below figure

Congratulations on setting up your accounts and learning with Markdown! 🥳

You're now ready to get started with your first contribution to Grey Software!💪

You'll use Markdown and Gitlab to add your profile to our [explorers page](https://org.grey.software/team/open-source-explorers/)!

<alert>
Our contribution guide will include a little bit of software development theory that you may or may not be familiar with.

If you're a seasoned software developer familiar with contributing to Git-based projects, you can go ahead and skip to the action items section of each page. 👍

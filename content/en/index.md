Welcome to the **Grey Software Onboarding Process**. We are delighted to have you join our mission to empower people to create and use open-source software (OSS). 

If you are new to the world of OSS development, this will be a great opportunity for you to get your first contribution.

If you know your way around Github, Gitlab, and other OSS tools, this will be a straightforward guide for registering yourself as part of the Grey Software organization.

We hope that the development tools and configuration settings we recommend enhance your OSS journey.

Welcome to the **Grey Software Onboarding Process** . 

We're delighted to have you join our mission to empower people to create and use open-source software (OSS). 

If you're new to the world of OSS, this is your opportunity to make your first contribution.

If you know your way around Github, Gitlab, and other open-source tools, this will be a pretty straightforward guide!

We hope that the tools and settings we recommend help you on your OSS journey! 😁

YAML is a human-readable data serialization language mainly used for configuration files 
and in applications in order to store or transmitted data. It is widely used by many programming languages 
like Java, Python, GoLang, and as a configuration language by Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Ansible, etc.

### The design goals for YAML are

1. YAML is easily readable by humans. 
2. YAML matches the native data structures of agile languages. 
3. YAML data is portable between programming languages. 
4. YAML has a consistent model to support generic tools. 
5. YAML supports one-pass processing. 
6. YAML is expressive and extensible. 
7. YAML is easy to implement and use

Relation with XML

YAML is a data serialization language while XML is designed to be backward compatible with the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  XML is designed to support structured documentation, where YAML is more closely targeted at data structures and messaging.

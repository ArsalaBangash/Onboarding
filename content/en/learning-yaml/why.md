**Kudos** to you on learning Markdown Language üèÅ

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)** human-readable data-serialization language for common everyday tasks and also a complete reference of the information needed to develop applications for processing YAML.
YAML was specifically created for common use cases such as log files, interprocess messaging, configuration files,cross-language data sharing, object persistence, and debugging of complex data structures. 
When data is easy to view and understand, programming becomes a simpler task.

### The design goals for YAML are

1. YAML is easily readable by humans. 
2. YAML matches the native data structures of agile languages. 
3. YAML data is portable between programming languages. 
4. YAML has a consistent model to support generic tools. 
5. YAML supports one-pass processing. 
6. YAML is expressive and extensible. 
7. YAML is easy to implement and use

Relation with XML

YAML is a data serialization language while XML is designed to be backward compatible with the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  XML is designed to support structured documentation, where YAML is more closely targeted at data structures and messaging.

## GitLab

Organizations rely on GitLabâ€™s source code management, CI/CD, security, and more to deliver software rapidly. 

We use Gitlab because it was easier to manage multiple organization projects using the platform!

Why do we use both Github and Gitlab?
We use Gitlab as our primary tool for software development and deployment. We use GitHub because of its vast community, classroom platform, and sponsorships program.</alert>

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is the largest social community for working professionals on the planet.

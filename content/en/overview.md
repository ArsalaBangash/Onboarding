## What is Version Control System 


## What is Git?


## Why Git?



## What are GitHub and GitLab and why we use both?

GitLab and GitHub are version control systems for managing source code in software development. When working in a team, developers can use these two platforms to edit source code, make changes, and perhaps most importantly, keep track of all changes they have made. Every single change can be precisely tracked and undone if necessary.

That's why here at Grey Software we preferred to have a GitLab and GitHub Account to get started with the Software Development Journey.

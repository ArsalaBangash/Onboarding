By the end of your onboarding process, we hope to equip you with the essential open source knowledge we think would best prepare you to collaborate with us. ðŸ’ª

This preparation is made up of:

- **Setting you up with essential accounts** 
- **Teaching you Markdown**
- **Giving you an applied exercise on Gitlab**

By the end, you'll have your profile card on on our [explorers page](https://org.grey.software/team/open-source-explorers/)

**[Let's get started!](/setup)**

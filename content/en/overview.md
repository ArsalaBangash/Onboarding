By the end of your onboarding process, we hope to equip you with the essential open source knowledge we think would best prepare you to collaborate with us. ðŸ’ª

This preparation is made up of:

- **Setting you up with essential accounts** 
- **Providing guidance and resources to help you learn core concepts and tools that facilitate distributed software development**
- **Walking you through an example development workflow that will give you applied experience with our tools and processes**

By the end, you'll have your profile card on on our [explorers page](https://org.grey.software/team/open-source-explorers/)

**[Let's get started!](/setup)**
